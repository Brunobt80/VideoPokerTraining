## How to play?

* play begins by placing a bet
* The player is then given 5 cards (the "deal")
* She has the opportunity to discard one or more of them
* those are exchanged for new ones drawn from the same virtual deck
* the game pays out if the hands played match one of the winning combinations
* the valid combinations are posted in the pay table
